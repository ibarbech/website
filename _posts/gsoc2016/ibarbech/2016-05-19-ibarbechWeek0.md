title: Who I am?  What will I make?

Hi! My name is Iván Barbecho Delgado, I'm from Extremadura and I was born on 25.04.1994 and I'm study computer engineering in School of Technology of University of Extremadura.
Actually I'm working in a project wich robolab, this consist in making walk a hexapod and put sensors.

I can not start my project, because I have perform exams, but when the exams are finished, I will work on the project thoroughly. For now I will work 1 to 2 hours a day in my project. In June, I will start my project seriously. This is my plan to work. 

My project will be divided into two parts, automatic code generation for State Machines once in C++ and other in python. So they can generate a componet with a state machine easily. This is very importar for save time when creating components that using state machines.

I work wich **DSL**(domain-specific language), **RoboComp**, **C++** and **Python.**
I will use mainly **Qt State Machine Framework.**

  Qt State Machine Framework: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/statemachine-api.html

  DSL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
