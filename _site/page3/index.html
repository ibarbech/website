      <i><b>RoboComp</b> is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</i>

        Debian Packaging <p>#1</p>
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2015</span>

    <h2>What is a binary package?</h2>

<p>A binary package in a is an application package which contains (pre-built) executables, as opposed to source code. Basically a binary package is an archive which contains executables some other info like rules on how to install them, dependencies etc. debian binary package is also a type of binary package. You can use a package manger to install these packages.I have explained I have explained it in tutorial <a href="http://robocomp.github.io/website/2015/05/23/nithin1.html">Debian packaging</a>.</p>

<h2>Implementation in Robocomp</h2>

<p>For binary packages i was left with two options. whether i could use the same cmake script i used for creating source packages or i could use the <code>CPACK</code> packaging tool. Finally i decided to go with CPACK because - 1)less code , that means less messing up 2)its an well known tool so is expected to perform better than a script i am writing. CPACK has so many configuration options so i made a seperate cmake file <code>package_details.cmake</code> for configuring cpack so that its easier for users to change any configuration. CPACK will add a target <code>package</code> for generating binary package. so you could run <code>make package</code> for generating the package. </p>

<h3>NB</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unfortunately CPACK has a bug in it, its not changing the control files permission correctly which throws a warning during installation. so i have create a bash script which will fix the control file permissions.</li>
</ul>

        <i>GSoC,</i> Symbolic planning techniques for recognizing objects domestic <p>#1</p>
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2015</span>

    <p><strong>About Me</strong> : Hello! My name is Mercedes Paoletti √Åvila, and I would like to introduce me a little in this first post. I&#39;m graduate in engineering from the University of Extremadura, and currently I study the Master in computer engineering and ICT management in the same University. Over the past two years I have been working in the Robotics Laboratory of the UEx, Robolab. There I developed my end grade work, &quot;inverse kinematics in social robots&quot;, using the robotic framework implemented by the laboratory, Robocomp, and now I&#39;m doing my Master&#39;s Thesis, that is about robots planners and is part of the project of LJ Manso, AGM. </p>

<p>And just following this course of action, this project combines the two concepts (planning and inverse kinematics) for recognizing and manipulating objects, using the framework Robocomp.</p>

<h2>Symbolic planning techniques for recognizing objects domestic</h2>

<p>The main object of this project is the application of symbolic techniques to build efficient pipelines in order to improve computer vision techniques, recognition and interpretation of domestic objects, to be finally executed on a domestic robot, so that the robot is able to move around a house and identify and interact with any objects located inside. The goal is that given a high-level task (eg. &quot;grab a mug&quot;), we can use symbolic planning techniques to build a pipeline of visual processing.</p>

<p>In order to reach this goal, we need some previous concepts:</p>

<p>1) We need a planner to organize the sequence of commands to be executed by the robot. We will use the AGM planner [1].</p>

<p>2) We need a system to recognize marks or some objects. For now, we wil use the algorithm proposed by Edwin Olson, AprilTags [2]</p>

<p>3) We also need a system that controls the movement of the robot and corrects the calibration errors and gaps of the engines. We will use the inverse kinematics component developed in Robocomp, which will add techniques of trajectory planning and visual feedback.</p>

<p>All this provides a robust support that allows the robot to move freely within a given environment, such as a home, and interact with everyday objects that are in it.</p>

<p>You can acces to the code of these components in the Robocomp repository: https://github.com/robocomp</p>

        Maintaining your own repository of components in GitHub
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <p>We recommend that you create a repository for your components (i.e. <em>mycomponents</em> directory in the example before) in your GitHub account (or other similar site) and pull/clone it in <em>~/robocomp/components</em> whenever yo need it. For example, if your GitHub account is <em>myaccount</em>, first log in with your browser and create a new repository named <em>mycomponents</em> following this instructions: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now is good time to write down a short description of what your component does in the README.md file.</p>

<p>Then we need to clean up the binary and generated files in <em>myfirstcomp</em>. Note that this is not necessary if you upload the component to the repo just after creating it with DSLEditor and before you type <em>cmake .</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd ~/robocomp/components/mycomponents/myfirstcomp
make clean
sudo rm -r CMakeFiles
rm CMakeCache.txt
rm cmake_install.cmake
rm Makefile
rm *.kd*
rm src/moc*
sudo rm -r src/CMakeFiles
rm src/cmake_install.cmake
rm src/Makefile
</code></pre></div>
<p>now we are ready:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd ~/robocomp/components/mycomponents
git init
git remote add origin &quot;https://github.com/myaccount/mycomponents.git&quot;
git add mycomponents
git push -u origin master
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can go now to GitHub and chek that your sources are there!</p>

        Using robocompdsl, The command line component generator
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <p><strong>robocompdsl</strong> is the new tool used in RoboComp to automatically generate components and modify their main properties once they have been generated (e.g., communication requirements, UI type). It is one of the core tools of the framework so, if you installed RoboComp, you can start using it right away.</p>

<p>This new version can only be used from the command line, but the languages used to define components and their interfaces remain mostly the same: <strong>CDSL</strong> to specify components and <strong>IDSL</strong> to specify interfaces. The only difference with the old RoboCompDSLEditor tool is that the reserved keywords (are now case independent). Take a look to the tutorial <a href="components.md">&quot;a brief introduction to Components&quot;</a> for an introduction to the concept of component generation and the languages involved.</p>

<p>There are three tasks we can acomplish using <strong>robocompdsl</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>generating a CDSL template file</li>
<li>generating the code for a previously existing CDSL file</li>
<li>regenerating the code for an already generated component.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Generating a CDSL template file</h2>

<p>Even tough writing CDSL files is easy --their structure is simple and the number of reserved words is very limited-- robocompdsl can generate template CDSL files to be used as a guide when writing CDSL files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ robocompdsl path/to/mycomponent/mycomponent.cdsl
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will generate a CDSL file with the following content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/import1.idsl&quot;;
import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/import2.idsl&quot;;

Component CHANGETHECOMPONENTNAME
{
    Communications
    {
        implements interfaceName;
        requires otherName;
        subscribesTo topicToSubscribeTo;
        publishes topicToPublish;
    };
    language Cpp;
    gui Qt(QWidget);
};
</code></pre></div>
<p>The CDSL language is described in the tutorial <a href="components.md">&quot;A brief introduction to Components&quot;</a>. Just don&#39;t forget to change the name of the component.</p>

<h2>Generating a component given a CDSL file</h2>

<p>Once we have our CDSL file we can generate the component&#39;s source code running robocompdsl with the CDSL file as first argument and the directory where the code should be placed as the second argument.</p>

<p>From the component&#39;s directory:
    $ cd path/to/mycomponent
    $ robocompdsl mycomponent.cdsl .</p>

<p>Or somewhere else:
    $ robocompdsl path/to/mycomponent/mycomponent.cdsl path/to/mycomponent</p>

<p>These commands will generate the C++ or Python code in the specified directory.</p>

<h2>Updating the source code of a component after modifying its CDSL file</h2>

<p>Once we generated our component we might change our mind and decide to add a new connection to another interface or to publish a new topic. In these cases we can regenerate the code of the component just by changing the <em>.cdsl</em> file and executing again the command.</p>

<p>As you might have learned from the tutorial <a href="components.md">&quot;A brief introduction to Components&quot;</a> RoboComp components are divided in specific code (files where you write your code) and generic code (autogenerated code which doesn&#39;t need to be edited). Running robocompdsl again on the same directory will ony overwrite these generic files. To ensure robocompdsl doesn&#39;t overwrite the changes you made to the specific files these are left unchanged, so the component might not compile after regeneration (e.g., you might need to add new methods).</p>

        Write a post for robocomp, A step by step guide.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <p>In this tutorial you will be learning about writing a post for robocomp. I assume that you are already familiar with contributing via Github if you are not then you can follow <a href="http://rajathkumarmp.github.io/robocomp/tutorial/2015/05/23/contribute.html">this article</a> and then come back here.</p>

<p>By now you would have already forked the repository.
Now switch to <code>gh-pages</code> branch
You can do this via github client or on the command line by navigating to the directory and executing the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">`git checkout gh-pages`
</code></pre></div>
<p>After checking out to the github pages branch in your navigate to the <code>_posts</code> directory. Here you will find all the posts.</p>

<p>To write a new post. Create a new file and save it as <code>XYZ.md</code></p>

<p>Note that you will be using Github markdown language.</p>

<p>Once you save the file as <code>XYZ.md</code>. It will be saved as draft and not published on to the website.</p>

<p>At the header of every article/post you write. Always add this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">---
layout:
title: 
categories:
tags:
description:
---
</code></pre></div>
<p>Layout can be <code>post</code>, <code>page</code> or <code>default</code>. Always set the layout as <code>post</code>. The title is the title of the post. Categories and Tags should be set accoridingly whichever is applicable. This is helpful in navigating or finding posts on same topic. Description is a short explanation or gist of the entire post.</p>

<p>A sample header looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">---
layout: post
title: Write a post for robocomp, A step by step guide.
categories: [Tutorial]
tags: [General]
description: In detail explanation as to how to write  a post for robocomp
---
</code></pre></div>
<p>After adding the header you can proceed writing the post by using Github Markdown language. Now for the most important step. To publish the post or to change the post from draft to final you will have to rename the file to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">`YYYY-MM-DD-XYZ.md`
</code></pre></div>
<p>That&#39;s it and you would successfully published a post on to the robocomp&#39;s website.</p>
