      <i><b>RoboComp</b> is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</i>

        Packaging RoboComp
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <h3>deb packages</h3>

<p>For creating a robocomp debian package :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd ~/robocomp
mkdir build
cmake ..
make package
</code></pre></div>
<p>will create a .deb package in the build directory, which we can install using any packaging application like dpkg. To install the created package, just double click on it(open with Software Center) or in terminal type</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sudo dpkg -i &lt;packagename&gt;.deb
</code></pre></div>
<h3>source packages for ppa</h3>

<p>Launchpad will only accept source packages and not binary.Launchpad will then build the packages. For building source packages we are using debuild which is a wrapper around the <em>dpkg-buildpackage + lintian</em>. so you will need to install debuild and dput on your system.The source_package.cmake script is used to create debian source package.</p>

<p>The main CMakeLists.txt file defines a target <code>spackage</code> that builds the source package in build/Debian with <code>make spackage</code></p>

<p>For uploading the package to ppa, First change the <strong>PPA_PGP_KEY</strong> in <a href="../cmake/package_details.cmake#L26">package_details.cmake</a> to the contact of the PGP key  details registered with your ppa account.Then create a source package by building the target <em>spackage</em>.Once the Source package is build successfully, upload it to your ppa by:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd Debian/
dput ppa:&lt;lp-username&gt;/&lt;ppa-name&gt; package-source.changes
</code></pre></div>
<p>building of source package can be tested with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd Debian/robocomp-&lt;version&gt;
debuild -i -us -uc
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Note:</h4>

<p>If you want to upload another source package to ppa which doesn&#39;t have any changes in the source but maybe in the debian files. you can build the spackage after commenting out <code>set(DEB_SOURCE_CHANGES &quot;CHANGED&quot; CACHE STRING &quot;source changed since last upload&quot;)</code> in <a href="../cmake/package_details.cmake#L27">package_details.cmake</a> so that the the script will only increase the ppa version number and wont include the source package for uploading to ppa (which otherwise will give an error).</p>

        <i>GSoC,</i> Building and deployment system design
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <h3>About Me:</h3>

<p>Hi all , I am Nithin Murali and i would like to introduce me a little in this post. I am pursuing my engineering degree on Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am working on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle which we are developing for the RObosub competition. We are developing in ROS framework. That was my first introduction to robotic frameworks. I have read about Robocomop before but a real chance to contribute to this ambitious framework was brought to me by GSOC 2015. I have Chosen the project <em>RoboComp Building and deployment system design</em>.</p>

<h3>About the project</h3>

<p>Currently the the build system in Robocomp is not very efficient. It is limited only to the core libraries and some additional tools. So we will have to seprately build all the components one by one. Also as the number of component increases it will be more difficult to manage all of them. So I am planning to come up with an workspace model for Robocomp. It would accompany with various tools which will ease handling of components.</p>

<p>As of now the users have to build robocomp from source for using it. But there may be users who dont want to work on the framework but is only interested in developing new components. For such users it is important that that we should supply an compiled package (preferably debian package). Also package would be more accessible if we could provide an ppa for robocomp. So i am planning to package robocomp and also create a ppa for robocomp.</p>

<p>Currently Robocomp dosent have any tests written nor is it using any testinf framework. So one of my task would be decide on a testing framework/stragery and write tests for existing framework.</p>

        Introduction to debian packaging
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <h2>What is a package</h2>

<p>By definition <em>Debian packages are standard Unix ar archives that include two tar archives optionally compressed with gzip (zlib), Bzip2, lzma, or xz (lzma2): one archive holds the control information and another contains the program data.</em>
All debain packages should follow certain conventions. The root source directory should contain a directory named <em>debian</em>. This directory contains files which stores info about the package.
These are the required files under the debian directory</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>rules</strong><br>
This is the maintainer script for the package building. This script is run by the packaging application to build and install the source into a <em>tmp</em> directory in the debian folder. It has the following Targets</p>

<ul>
<li><em>clean target</em> : to clean all compiled, generated, and useless files in the build-tree.</li>
<li><em>build target</em> : to build the source into compiled programs and formatted documents in the build-tree.</li>
<li><em>build-arch target</em> : to build the source into arch-dependent compiled programs in the build-tree.</li>
<li><em>build-indep target</em> : to build the source into arch-independent formatted documents in the build-tree.</li>
<li><em>binary target</em> : to create all binary packages (effectively a combination of binary-arch and binary-indep targets)</li>
<li><em>binary-arch target</em> : to create arch-dependent (Architecture: any) binary packages in the parent directory.</li>
<li><em>binary-indep target</em>: to create arch-independent (Architecture: all) binary packages in the parent directory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>changelog</strong><br>
This file contains the project changelog along with the project name , version and distribution and urgency of your package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>compact</strong><br>
The compact file defines the debhelper compatibility level.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>debian/control</strong><br>
This file contains various values which dpkg, dselect, apt-get, apt-cache, aptitude, and other package management tools will use to manage the package. The control file describes the source and binary package, and gives some information about them, such as their names, who the package maintainer is, build and run dependencies and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>copyright</strong><br>
This file contains information about the copyright and license of the upstream sources</p></li>
<li><p><strong>(pre/post)(inst/rm)</strong><br>
This are the scipts which are run before or after installation or removal of package.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now once you have the source directory in the prescribed format. you will need a <em>.tar.gz</em> archive of the source in the same folder.Then we can create a debian binary package using </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">debuild -i -us -uc -b
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or a debian source package using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">debuild -i -us -uc -S
</code></pre></div>

        Software components in RoboComp, A brief introduction
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <p>Two major problems encountered when creating large, complex software are scalability and reusability. These problems become especially acute when it comes to writing the software that controls today robots. Robotics is the mixed bag of technology, where almost everything finds its way through. Also, Robotics is the place where our dreams of intelligent machines meet, in an endless attempt to build a truly useful tool for our daily lives. Because of this, we organize the software for our robots in big architectures that try to reproduce whatever we understand by intelligent behavior. The most audacious architectures are called <em>cognitive architectures</em> and try to integrate all levels of behavior and reasoning needed to achieve intelligence. Some of them have been with us for more than 30 years, <a href="http://soar.eecs.umich.edu/">SOAR.</a></p>

<p>The problem with building these little monsters is that you need a very powerful underlying infrastructure that lets you build and modify software created by many people and that has to execute on real, moving machines. Also, everybody expect robots to be smarter than they really are and that is a lot of preassure. Components provide a new, developing technology that can be very helpful here. Components are <em>programs that communicate</em> and as such, they are built with everything at hand, libraries, objects, threads, sockets, lambda functions and any other thing you can come up with to code a program. Also, components need a way to communicate among them and here is where communication middlewares get in. If you want to communicate programs written in different languages, running across the internet, executing on different hardware architectures -even browsers- then you cannot get along with a socket. You really need a middleware. Putting together these to elements, programs and a communication middleware, you almost come up with a component. One more thing is needed, a model for your components. You need to define what is a generic component and consequently how its internal structure is going to be, its directory and building ecosystem, how it has to be documented, its default behavior, how it will be deployed and its modes of communicating. There are several proposals that do exactly this, being the most famous <a href="http://www.corba.org">CORBA.</a></p>

<p>In RoboComp (2005-) we have created our own component model, inspired by the <a href="http://orca-robotics.sourceforge.net/">ORCA</a> model and making it evolve to fit our needs along these years. As a middleware, RoboComp primarily uses <a href="www.zeroc.com">Ice</a> and there is ongoing experimental work to make RoboComp middleware agnostic, so its components can be re-generated to use other middlewares such as <a href="http://portals.omg.org/dds/">DDS</a>.</p>

<p>RoboComp&#39;s components model is quite simple and we always try to simplify it even more. It can be best explained through two Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) that have been created to define a component at a very high level of abstraction. <strong>IDSL</strong> stands for &quot;Interface Definition Specific Language&quot; and currently is a subset of Ice&#39;s Slice interface language. With IDSL you write the data structures and functions that a component can implement, require, subscribe to or publish. A component can implement several interfaces, offering different views of its internal functioning. Also, the same interface can be implemented by many components. This is an example of a simple interface written in IDSL:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">module RoboCompSpeech
{
  interface Speech
  {
     bool say(string text,bool overwrite);
     bool isBusy();
  };
};
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>CDSL</strong> stands for &quot;Component Definition Specific Language&quot; and allows the user to specifiy its name, accesible interfaces, communication connections, target language and other available modules or libraries that you want to include in the building scripts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/DifferentialRobot.idsl&quot;;
import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/Laser.idsl&quot;;
Component prueba
{
    Communications
    {
      requires DifferentialRobot, Laser;
    };
    language cpp;
    gui Qt(QWidget);
};
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using these two DSLs, RoboComp can generate the source code of the component using a tool designed to this end. The complete, functioning code of a component is created ready to be compiled and executed. We use a smart inheritance mechanism to separate the generic stuff from the user specific stuff and, based on it, the next time you generate a component, your code will remain untouched but access to new defined proxies will be there.</p>

        Creating a new component with eclipse based RoboComp's DSLEditor
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2015</span>

    <p>We will create now a new component that will connect to the RCIS simulator and run a simple controller for the robot, using the laser data. First we need to install the DSLEditor software that is runtime Eclipse application. </p>

<p>Create another terminal in Yakuake and type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd ~/robocomp/tools
python fetch_DSLEditor.py
</code></pre></div>
<p>Select 32 or 64 bits according to your current linux installation. After a little while the DSLEditor will be installed under the <em>robocompDSL</em> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd roboCompDSL/DSLEditor
./DSLEditor
</code></pre></div>
<p>Check that you have a <em>RoboComp</em> tab in the upper bar of the DSLEditor window and that the <em>robocomp</em> directory appears in the Project Explorer (left panel). If it does not, right click inside the <em>Project Explorer</em> panel and select <em>import</em>. Then select <em>General</em> and then <em>Existing Projects into Workspace</em>. Then select your <em>robocomp</em> directory and push <em>Finish</em>. </p>

<p>Now we need to bring up some handy tabs in the lower pane. Select the <em>Window</em> tab in the upper bar, then <em>Show View</em>, then <em>Other</em> and again <em>Other</em>. Select now <em>Interfaces</em> and double-click on it. Go back to the main window.</p>

<p>Now, in the left panel, unfold the <em>robocomp</em> directory down to <em>robocomp/components/</em> and then click on it with the right button. Select <em>New Folder</em> and enter <em>mycomponents</em> in the folder name. Do it again to create a new folder inside <em>mycomponents</em> named <em>myfirstcomp</em>. Select <em>myfirstcomp</em> and then click on the <em>RoboComp</em> tab in the upper bar of the main window. Select <em>Create CDSL file</em> and fill the requested name with <em>MyFirstComp.cdsl</em></p>

<p>The new file will open inside a syntax-sensitive editor in the central panel. Ctrl-space gives you syntactically correct options. You can see the skeleton of a new empty component. Look for the tab <em>Interfaces</em> in the lower bar and select <em>DifferentialRobot.idsl</em>. Click on the green cross at the right of the bar to include it and accept when prompted in a pop-up window. You will see something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/DifferentialRobot.idsl&quot;;
Component PFLocalizerComp{
    Communications{
        };
        language Cpp;
};
</code></pre></div>
<p>Repeat the same steps to include <em>Laser.idsl</em> and then add a <em>requires</em> statement inside de <em>Communications</em> section. The file now should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/DifferentialRobot.idsl&quot;;
import &quot;/robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs/Laser.idsl&quot;;
Component MyFirstComp{
    Communications{
        requires DifferentialRobot, Laser;
    };
language Cpp;
};
</code></pre></div>
<p>Save the file and click in the upper bar on the <em>RoboComp</em> tab. Select <em>Generate Code</em>. After a little while the new source tree for your <em>MyFirstComp</em> component will be created. You can go back now to Yakuake and create a new tab to compile it. Then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd ~/robocomp/components/mycomponents/myfirstcomp
cmake .
make
bin/myfirstcomp --Ice.Config=etc/generic_config
</code></pre></div>
<p>and there it is! your component is running. </p>

<p>What! Dissapointed? Yeah, I know it does nothing, but it runs and it is yours! Now let&#39;s do some real programming.</p>

<p>Stop the component with Ctrl Z and then type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">killall -9 myfirstcomp
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now start your favorite IDE. KDevelop will do it just fine and you have it already installed. Open it in another tab, from Ubuntu menu or with Alt-F2. Then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Click the *Project* tab in the upper bar
Select *Open/Import Project*
Navigate to ~/robocomp/components/mycomponents/myfirstcomp
Select *Makefile* and open the project
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the <em>Project</em> panel to the left of the screen, navigate to <em>src</em> and there select <em>specificworker.cpp</em> and open it. Open also <em>specificworker.h</em></p>

<p>Now replace the empty <em>void compute()</em> method with this compact version of the classic AVOID-FORWARD-STOP architecture proposed by R. Brooks in the late 80&#39;s:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">void SpecificWorker::compute( )
{
    static  float rot = 0.1f;           // rads/sec
    static float adv = 100.f;           // mm/sec
    static float turnSwitch = 1;
    const float advIncLow = 0.8;        // mm/sec
    const float advIncHigh = 2.f;       // mm/sec
    const float rotInc = 0.25;          // rads/sec
    const float rotMax = 0.4;           // rads/sec
    const float advMax = 200;           // milimetres/sec
    const float distThreshold = 500;    // milimetres
try
{
    RoboCompLaser::TLaserData ldata = laser_proxy-&gt;getLaserData();
    std::sort( ldata.begin(), ldata.end(), [](RoboCompLaser::TData a, RoboCompLaser::TData b){ return     a.dist &lt; b.dist; }) ;
    if( ldata.front().dist &lt; distThreshold) 
    {
        adv = adv * advIncLow; 
        rot = rot + turnSwitch * rotInc;
        if( rot &lt; -rotMax) rot = -rotMax;
        if( rot &gt; rotMax) rot = rotMax;
        differentialrobot_proxy-&gt;setSpeedBase(adv, rot);
    }
    else
    {
        adv = adv * advIncHigh; 
        if( adv &gt; advMax) adv = advMax;
        rot = 0.f;
        differentialrobot_proxy-&gt;setSpeedBase(adv, 0.f);        
        turnSwitch = -turnSwitch;
    }   
}
catch(const Ice::Exception &amp;ex)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ex &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>To compile the fancy version of <em>std::sort</em> you will have to first add this line at the end of the file <em>CMakeListsSpecific.txt</em> located in the same <em>src</em> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ADD_DEFINITIONS( -std=c++11 )
</code></pre></div>
<p>and then type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cmake .
make
</code></pre></div>
<p>Hereafter, Press F8 in KDevelop to compile and link. Then, go to Yakuake and restart the component. </p>

<p>Let us take InnerModel <em>simpleworld.xml</em> as an example. Open a new tab in Yakuake and execute</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd robocomp/files/innermodel
rcis simpleworld.xml
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you should see 2 windows. Now in Yakuake go back to tab where you had compiled <em>myfirstcomp</em> and run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">bin/myfirstcomp --Ice.Config=etc/generic_config
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should see the robot maneouvring aroung the box. Now is when Robotics begin! Try to modify the code to let the robot go pass the blocking boxes.</p>
